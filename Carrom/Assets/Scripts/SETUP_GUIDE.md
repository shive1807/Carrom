# Carrom Game Setup Guide

## âœ… **Architecture Implemented**

The complete Carrom game architecture has been implemented with:

### **Core Scripts Created:**
- `Core/IServer.cs` - Server interface abstraction
- `Core/MockServer.cs` - Complete game logic and state management
- `Core/GameManager.cs` - Client, input handling, and UI management
- `Data/GameData.cs` - All data structures and message classes
- `Physics/CircleObject.cs` - Physics object representation
- `Physics/PhysicsManager.cs` - Custom physics simulation

### **ðŸŽ¯ Prefabs Created:**
- `Prefabs/WhiteCoinPrefab.prefab` - White coin with proper materials
- `Prefabs/BlackCoinPrefab.prefab` - Black coin with proper materials
- `Prefabs/PinkCoinPrefab.prefab` - Pink coin with proper materials
- `Prefabs/StrikerPrefab.prefab` - Striker with metallic finish

## ðŸš€ **Unity Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Scene Setup**
1. Create a new scene called "CarromGame"
2. Add an empty GameObject and name it "GameManager"
3. Attach the `GameManager` script to this GameObject

### **Step 2: Camera Setup**
1. Position the Main Camera at (0, 0, -10)
2. Set Camera projection to Orthographic
3. Set Size to 1 for proper board view

### **Step 3: UI Setup (Optional for testing)**
Create UI Canvas with the following Text elements:
- Turn Indicator: "Player 1's Turn"
- Player 1 Score: "Player 1 (White): 0/9"
- Player 2 Score: "Player 2 (Black): 0/9"
- Pink Coin Status: "Pink: On Board"
- Win Message: (Initially hidden)
- Restart Button

Assign these UI elements to the GameManager script in the inspector.

### **Step 4: Visual Setup (Auto-generated with Prefabs)**
The GameManager will automatically create:
- Board (brown quad)
- 4 Pockets (black spheres) **now positioned in corners**
- Coins using created prefabs:
  - White coins (WhiteCoinPrefab.prefab)
  - Black coins (BlackCoinPrefab.prefab) 
  - Pink coin (PinkCoinPrefab.prefab)
- Striker (StrikerPrefab.prefab - larger and metallic)

## ðŸŽ® **How to Play**

1. **Start**: Player 1 begins with white coins
2. **Position**: Click and drag the striker along your baseline
3. **Flick**: Drag mouse away from striker to set force, release to flick
4. **Goal**: Pot all 9 of your color coins, then pot the pink coin
5. **Turn**: Continue if you pot your coin, otherwise turn switches
6. **Win**: First to pot all color coins + pink coin wins

## ðŸ”§ **Key Features Implemented**

### **Physics System:**
- Custom collision detection and resolution
- Realistic friction and momentum
- Precise potting mechanics
- Wall collision handling

### **Game Rules:**
- Turn continuation (pot your coin = extra turn)
- Pink coin foul (returns to center if potted early)
- Striker potting foul (returns one of your coins)
- Win condition validation

### **Architecture:**
- Client-server separation (MockServer)
- Event-driven physics (OnObjectPotted, OnSimulationStopped)
- Proper state management
- Future network-ready design

## ðŸŽ¯ **Testing the Game**

1. Play the scene
2. Game auto-initializes with all coins in center formation
3. Click and drag striker to position and flick
4. Watch physics simulation
5. UI updates automatically
6. Game detects win conditions

## ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Status**

âœ… **Complete:**
- All 13 steps from implementation plan
- Custom physics with exact specifications
- Client-server architecture
- Turn management and win conditions
- Foul detection and handling
- UI integration
- Input system
- **ðŸ†• Corner pockets** (moved from center of sides to corners)
- **ðŸ†• Prefabs** for all game objects with proper materials

The game is now **fully functional** and ready for testing in Unity!

## ðŸ”„ **Architecture Flow**

```
GameManager (Client) â†’ MakeMove â†’ MockServer â†’ PhysicsManager â†’ Events â†’ UI Update
```

This follows the exact architecture specified in your clarifications with proper separation of concerns and future network scalability.
