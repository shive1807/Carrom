# ðŸŽ¯ Game Design Document (GDD) - 2 Player Carrom Game

#### -- Create a game-design-document of a 2 player carrom game, the carrom game is build in unity and its a multiplayer game over network, for now we don't have a network  so we will create a module which will mock the game server, the mock server will run inside the unity and for second player we will make pass and play type of game. They game will have physics which is custom build, there will be three types of coins on the board white, black and pick, 9 white 9 black and one pink, the player should pot all there color and at last need to pot the pink, for board configuration it will be a square board, with 4 pots in the center. Lets write a GDD for the above specified rules, improve it if you want to add any other rule.

# ðŸŽ¯ Communication Requirement
#### -- based on the gdd and the game requirements design the game states and the communication between client and server, message codes and define the fields that these message codes will hold.

# ðŸŽ¯ Physics Module
#### --  Let's write a physics common module for a C# unity project which our carrom game will use.\
